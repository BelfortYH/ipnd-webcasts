Question & Answer
-----------------

>**Question:** Why are there so many different channels for students to write their code? ([Scratchpad][scratchpad], [Codepen][codepen], [Sublime Text Editor][sublime]...)

**Answer:** All the tools discussed so far in the Nanodegree Program let you write and run code, but they're all good at different things. 

  * We start out with [Scratchpad][scratchpad] because it gives you instant feedback as you make changes to your  code. The  right pane will re-render automatically as the HTML code in the left pane changes---this  will make it easier to catch mistakes. 
  * [Codepen][codepen] gives you the option to write in HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript. It also lets you share your  code  easily. All you have to do is hit save and you'll have a link to your work that you can sent to family and friends.
  * [Sublime][sublime] is the most professional tool that you'll use. There are lots of features in sublime  that will take some getting used to, such as specifying the appropriate coding language for the file. This is important so sublime can get the syntax highlighting and indentation correct.

I would recommend that you start out in Scratchpad, then move on to Codepen when you'd like to share something, and then when you start programming in Python, you can worry about Sublime.

>**Question:** How can I check if my project submission of Project 1 is visible in GitHub?

 **Answer:** If you don't get an email saying that an error has occurred, then you're fine. 

>**Question:** What tips do you have to make sure that I am organizing my code properly? 

**Answer:** For simple projects, you can save the HTML and CSS files in the same folder. If the  project is more complex, you may want to consider adding more folders. You could have a folder called style sheets for your CSS files and a folder called HTML for your HTML templates (we'll  more about to that later in the program). 

If you are talking about organizing code within a certain file, like an HTML file, in general it's good to get your structure down first. You don't have to worry about the content of your div's,  your p tags, and anything else at first. I like to look at the wave that the indents and "de-dents" create in an HTML file, that's the structure of your document. I can look at the wave, I know that everything that is inside of a certain indent level belongs to the same "parent" container. 

>**Question:** After the Intro to Programming Nanodegree program, what Nanodegree program do you suggest?

**Answer:** You have lots of options depending on your ambitions.

  * Front-End Web Development: If you like designing web pages, adding cool features to a website, or anything else related to the user interface of a website this is a great Nanodegree program for you.
  * Full-Stack Web Development: If you're interested in algorithms, a procedural sort of thinking this is a good option for you. You can learn to use data to create something useful, like Google Maps. You'll also get the opportunity to learn concepts from the Front-End Nanodegree program too. It pretty much covers the whole package of skills that are useful for web development.
  * iOS Development: This Nanodegree program is good if you're interested in creating apps for iPhones or iPads.
  * Data Analysis: The Data Analyst Nanodegree program is great if you're interesting in using data to learn more about a population. You'll learn how to deal with large data sets so you can discover relationships, patterns, or trends. 

>**Question:** Does Udacity want students to submit work for review as we complete each stage or each work session between the stages?

**Answer:** The best time to submit your project would be at each stage in the portal that asks you to submit your project. This will give us enough time to give you meaningful comments on your code as your work through the Nanodegree program. 

Feel free to post your code on the forums during the intermediate stages! It's a great chance to get feedback on your code from your classmates. Please remember to be respectful and constructive when providing feedback. And don't forget that when you receive feedback, the reviewer is commenting on your code, they're not commenting on your abilities as a programmer.

>**Question:** There seems to be a variety of where comments are posted. (Google circles and discussion forums) The same can be said for project stage submission locations. (Codepen, Google circles, GitHub, etc...) What tool does Udacity want student to use for each media?

**Answer:** For submissions, use the link in the Nanodegree portal. There you'll have the option to submit through GitHub or with a zipped file. You'll need a GitHub account regardless of which method you choose. As for discussions, it's best to post to the Udacity discussion forums. This leads to better discussions since it has the means to post code to the forums. The Google community page is really for announcing and hosting office hours while the discussions forum is the place to interact with Udacity staff and your colleagues. 

>**Question:** Has the majority of the class completed Stage 1 and met 'all specifications?' I assume we need to start Stage 2 this week.

**Answer:** We do hope that students have completed Stage 1 at this point. We however understand that it is difficult to stay on track with the material. We do hope that you will let us know if you're stuck on Stage 1, you can always post to the discussion forums. We do expect you to complete Stage 1 and Stage 2 by the specified date. If it happens that you can't meet the deadlines, that's not a problem. You'll just be reassigned to the cohort that started after you. This will give you the chance to catch up with the material and place you with students who are at a similar stage in the Nanodegree program. There are no penalties for missing a deadline. 

>**Question:** I noticed there is a chat capability when I am going through a lesson. How do I use this and who will I be chatting with?

**Answer:** You use it by clicking on the chat bubble and a list of chat room will show up. Choose the group you'd like to join and just start chatting. You'll be speaking with other students in your Nanodegree cohort in the same chat group.

>**Question:** Before starting the Nanodegree program, I remember reading that AT&T is committed to offering up to 100 internships to underscore their commitment to the potential of the Nanodegree programs. When the time comes, how would one go about being considered for an internship?

**Answer:** The internships are being offered for the Front-End Nanodegree program right now. We would encourage you to sign up for that Nanodegree program after you finish the Intro to Programming Nanodegree program. After you complete both programs, you'll have the necessary skills that AT&T is looking for. Also keep in mind that you shouldn't complete the Front-End Nanodegree program just because AT&T is offering internships. You should work towards the Nanodegree that interests you the most. If you work really hard on your projects, you'll develop employable skills. 

>**Question:** If I understand correctly, we can submit our projects a few times for review before it's finally considered for grading. I'm not sure how to signal that my submission is final and not a requires for review. How do I do this?

**Answer:** If you submit something to Udacity, we will interpret that as final and ready for review. As part of the grading process, you may receive feedback on your project. This is just to make sure that you are prepared for the next stage in the Nanodegree program. Don't be afraid to submit if you don't think you'll receive a passing grade, the point of the process is to receive feedback so you can improve.

>**Question:** Is the W3C validation service going to be a part of my new life as a programmer?

**Answer:** It might be if you choose to keep using it. It also depends on what you decide your life as a programer will be like. It may be frustrating to use the W3C validator, but it's a great way to double check your code for errors.

>**Question:** In the discussion forum, many colleagues have expressed challenges using GitHub. Udacity seemed to indicated that they were developing additional tools to help students understand how to navigate GitHub. Is this true?

**Answer:** There currently is the option to submit a zip file instead of using a GitHub repository on the submission page. 

>**Question:** Is it possible to complete the Intro to Programming Nanodegree program within 1 month? Are there any required exams/assessments before we can earn a Nanodegree certificate? Will there be a final exam? 

**Answer:** I don't recommend finishing the Nanodegree program within 1 month, it will be very difficult to complete the projects in that amount of time. There won't be a final exam. The Intro to Programming Nanodegree program is project based. The "final exam" is actually a final project.

>**Question:** If we find information on the internet that is useful for course topics, do you want us to post that information to the forums?

**Answers:** Yes! Share every incredible resource you find!

Advice to students
------------------
Social learning is one of the most valuable ways to learn. Don't feel afraid to ask questions and don't worry about what people may think of you for asking a question. Getting over this hurdle will help you succeed at learning. It's totally okay if you don't understand something, your classmates and Udacity coaches are here to help!
